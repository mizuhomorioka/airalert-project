# air alert project
## about this project
this is a repository for my fourth (and last) project of [the Lede program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/).
I visited Ukraine last summer for reporting. At that time, Lviv, the city I stayed for three weeks seemed quiet and peaceful. However, one night, I was woken up by an air raid alarm. I still remember that unsettling sound.
The war has been going on for more than a year, and people are still trying to maintain their daily lives. But the sound of the air raid alarm reminds them that we are still at war.

## Data Source
I used [alerts in ua](https://alerts.in.ua/en), which track the time and place of all the air alerts. I scraped the data, and calculated the average length of under air alert.

## Things I learned
I used scrolltelling and made an interactive chart successfully. Also I put a map from mapbox, and embed video and sound.

## Things I'd like to do
I was supposed to get data by scraping [telegram channel](https://t.me/s/air_alert_ua), but I failed. I will keep trying it.
